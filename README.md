## Learning Resources

**Courses:**
- CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard)
- Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course
- Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning
- Hugging Face's NLP course

**Books:**
- "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes
- "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville
- "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" by Lewis Tunstall et al.

**Platforms:**
- Kaggle for datasets and competitions
- Hugging Face for models and datasets
- GitHub to explore open-source projects

## Practice Tips

1. **Daily Code:** Write code every day, even if just for 30 minutes
2. **Project-Based Learning:** Build complete projects rather than just tutorials
3. **Explain Concepts:** Try teaching what you learn to cement understanding
4. **Community Participation:** Join Discord servers, Reddit communities, and local meetups
5. **Documentation Practice:** Document your projects thoroughly on GitHub

Remember that consistent practice is more important than speed. Adjust this timeline as needed based on your available time and learning pace.
